# NVIDIA JetPack 7 software stack

## NVIDIA JetPack

NVIDIA JetPack™ is the official software stack for the NVIDIA Jetson™ platform, giving you a comprehensive suite of tools and libraries for building AI-powered edge applications. JetPack 7, the latest evolution in the series, is the most advanced software stack yet, purpose-built to enable cutting-edge robotics and generative AI at the edge. It’s agentic-ready with NVIDIA® NemoClaw™ and purpose-built Jetson agent skills, so you can set up edge AI workflows with a single command. With full support for NVIDIA Jetson platforms, JetPack 7 provides ultra-low latency, deterministic performance, and scalable deployment for machines that interact with the physical world.

## JetPack 7 Overview

JetPack 7 gives you full support for the NVIDIA Jetson [Orin](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/) ™ and [Thor](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-thor/) ™ platform, preemptable real-time kernel, Multi-Instance GPU (MIG), and integrated [Holoscan Sensor Bridge](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/holoscan-sensor-bridge/). Built on Linux Kernel 6.8 and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, and designed with a modular, cloud-native architecture, it integrates the latest NVIDIA AI compute stack and seamlessly integrates with NVIDIA AI workflows. Whether you’re developing humanoid robots or building an application with the most demanding generative AI workload, JetPack 7 delivers the software foundation to bring them to life.

JetPack 7 is also agent-friendly and optimized for popular AI agents with purpose-built Jetson agent skills. This lets developers quickly set up agentic workflows and accelerate development time. [JetPack 7.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/deploy-agentic-ready-ai-at-the-edge-with-memory-efficiency-in-nvidia-jetpack-7-2/) also officially supports the Yocto Project on Jetson, enabling custom, reproducible Linux distributions for optimized performance and deterministic edge AI deployments.

Jetson agent skills help developers build, configure, optimize, and measure Jetson applications through reusable workflows. Key skills include Jetson Linux customization for faster time to market through automated BSP bring-up for custom carrier boards, memory optimization to run more capable workloads on smaller memory footprints and lower TCO, and model benchmarking to find the optimal model configuration for each Jetson device.

With JetPack 7, Jetson software aligns with the Server Base System Architecture (SBSA), positioning Jetson Thor alongside industry-standard Arm server design. SBSA standardizes critical hardware and firmware interfaces, delivering stronger OS support, simpler software portability, and smoother enterprise integration. Building on this foundation, Jetson Thor now supports a unified NVIDIA® CUDA® 13.0 installation across all Arm targets, streamlining development, reducing fragmentation, and ensuring consistency from server-class systems to Jetson Thor.

## Agentic Frameworks on JetPack SDK

Note: Jetson Thor is based on the SBSA stack. Please use the SBSA installer when installing from the links below.

#### NemoClaw

JetPack 7 is built for agentic AI. Starting with JetPack 7.2, NVIDIA NemoClaw can be installed with a single command, enabling developers to easily run and orchestrate both local and cloud AI models on Jetson devices. This simplifies building intelligent, autonomous, and multimodal edge AI applications.

#### Jetson Agent Skills

Agent skills package NVIDIA expertise into reusable, agent-deployable workflows that help developers build, configure, optimize, and validate systems with clear guidance and developer-in-the-loop controls, turning manual tasks like BSP customization, memory optimization, and model benchmarking into structured workflows that reduce risk, time to market, and TCO.
