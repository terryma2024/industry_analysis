# NVIDIA Jetson FAQ current pricing and lifecycle

## What is Jetson?

NVIDIA <sup>®</sup> Jetson is the world's leading platform for [AI at the edge](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/). It combines high-performance, low-power compute modules with the NVIDIA AI software stack. It’s the ideal platform for advanced robotics and other autonomous products.

For more information, see the NVIDIA Jetson [Developer Site](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded). For product datasheets and other technical collateral, see the [Jetson Download Center](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads).

## What is JetPack?

JetPack is NVIDIA’s software stack for Jetson platforms. It integrates Jetson Linux, AI compute stack, AI frameworks, a holistic set of libraries and developer tools into one package. It provides everything needed to build, deploy, and optimize AI-powered edge applications on Jetson devices. Refer to the [JetPack page](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) to learn more.

## What version of JetPack should I use?

JetPack 7 supports Jetson Thor with Linux 24.04 LTS, Kernel 6.8 our latest compute stack and libraries. It will support Jetson Orin series 2026

JetPack 6 is in sustaining mode. It supports Jetson Orin with production-ready feature releases. It also supports Jetson Platform Services, Upgradable AI compute stack and a broad support for popular distros and kernels.

JetPack 5 is in sustaining mode. It supports Jetson Orin and Jetson Xavier with production-ready feature releases.

JetPack 4 is EoL and supports Jetson Xavier, Jetson TX2, and Jetson Nano.

JetPack 4 – JetPack 4 was first released in 2018 with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and kernel 4.9. Jetpack 4 was announced [End of Life](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/announcing-end-of-life-for-nvidia-jetpack-4-with-the-release-of-jetpack-4-6-6/314300) in November 2024. NVIDIA encourages developers to leverage the expertise of Jetson Ecosystem partners including [TimeSys](https://www.timesys.com/solutions/linux-os-bsp-maintenance/) and [Codethink](https://www.codethink.co.uk/linux.html) for further Kernel maintenance. For seamless support continuity on Jetson Xavier modules, we suggest developers transition to the latest JetPack available for their platform.

## Does Jetson support running generative AI models? How can I get started?

The NVIDIA Jetson platform is uniquely capable of running any kind of generative AI model locally, including LLMs, vision transformers, VLMs and Stable Diffusion. Jetson AGX Orin delivers leading performance in the MLPerf Benchmark for generative AI at the embedded edge.

## Where can I buy Jetson products?

Jetson products are available from distributors and e-tailers, as well as from NVIDIA. See [this link](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/buy "Buy the Latest Jetson Products | NVIDIA Developer") for a full listing.

## What is the difference between Jetson Developer Kits and Jetson modules?

Each Jetson developer kit includes a non-production specification Jetson module attached to a reference carrier board. Together with JetPack SDK, it is used to develop and test software for your use case. Jetson developer kits are not intended for production use.

Jetson modules are suitable for deployment in a production environment throughout their [operating lifetime](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/faq#jetson-lifetime). Each Jetson module ships with no software pre-installed; you attach it to a carrier board designed or procured for your end product, and flash it with the software image you’ve developed.

## What is the difference between the Jetson AGX Orin Developer Kit with 32GB vs. 64GB?

The Jetson AGX Orin Developer Kit has been upgraded with 64GB of memory. The performance is the same as the original 32GB Jetson AGX Orin Developer Kit, except for the memory. The price of the Jetson AGX Orin developer kit with 64GB of memory is $3499.

In addition, the production Jetson AGX Orin 64GB and Jetson AGX Orin 32GB modules have different memory, AI compute and performances. Please refer to the [technical specifications table here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/#tech-specs) for details.

## What is the Jetson Orin Nano Super Developer Kit, and how does the hardware differ from the original Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit?

The NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super Developer Kit is a compact, yet powerful computer that redefines generative AI for small edge devices. It delivers up to 67 TOPS of AI performance—a 1.7X improvement over its predecessor—to seamlessly run all kinds of generative AI models, like vision transformers, large language models, vision-language models, and more.  
  
The Jetson Orin Nano Super has no physical hardware and package differences compared to the Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit. The performance upgrade comes from software optimization. Existing Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit users can experience this performance boost with just a software update.

## How can I enable Super Mode on my Jetson Orin? Will Jetson Orin Super Mode require new carrier board, thermal design and power solutions?

Jetson Orin Super Mode, designed to accelerate AI performance for Jetson Orin NX and Orin Nano series, is natively available from [JetPack 6.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-61) onwards. NVIDIA provides a new flash configuration file for customers who need improved performance. The new flash config supports a 25W power mode and MAXN power mode for the Jetson Orin Nano series and a 40W power mode and MAXN power mode for Jetson Orin NX series of production modules.  
  
The Jetson Orin Super Mode requires a higher power budget and customers may need to redesign their carrier boards and thermal solutions to enable the super mode. For the Orin NX series, the carrier board must have an HV rail to enable super mode and thermal designs need to support 40W. For the Orin Nano series, the carrier board and thermal design can refer to Jetson Orin Nano developer kit.

## Can Jetson developer kits be used as production systems or as part of a product?

No. Jetson developer kits are not for production use. The developer kit is used to develop and test software in a pre-production environment.

Jetson modules are designed for deployment in a production environment throughout their [operating lifetime](#jetson-lifetime).

|  | Jetson developer kit | Jetson module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operating Lifetime | None specified | 5 or 10 year operating life in a production environment |
