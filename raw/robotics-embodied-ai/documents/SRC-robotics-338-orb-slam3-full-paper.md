                          the University of Oxford, U.K., and Imperial College
                          London, U.K.
                             He is currently a full professor with the Depar-
                          tamento de Informática e Ingenierı́a de Sistemas,
                          Universidad de Zaragoza, where he is in charge of
                          perception and computer vision research grants and
courses. His interests include real-time visual SLAM for rigid and non-rigid
environments, and the transference of this technology to robotic and non-
robotic application domains. He has received several awards, including the
2015 King-Sun Fu Memorial IEEE Transactions on Robotics Best Paper
Award. Since 2020 he coordinates the EU FET EndoMapper grant to bring
visual SLAM to intracorporeal medical scenes.




                        Juan D. Tardós (Huesca, Spain, 1961) received the
                        M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering
                        from the University of Zaragoza, Spain, in 1985
                        and 1991, respectively. He is Full Professor with

                        Sistemas, University of Zaragoza, where he is in
                        charge of courses in robotics, computer vision, and
                        artificial intelligence. His research interests include
                        SLAM, perception and mobile robotics. He received
                        the 2015 King-Sun Fu Memorial IEEE Transactions
                        on Robotics Best Paper Award, for the paper de-
scribing the monocular SLAM system ORB-SLAM.
