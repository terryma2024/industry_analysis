# MediaPipe Python setup guide

This page shows you how to set up your development environment to use MediaPipe Tasks in your Python applications.

## Supported platforms and versions

Building applications with MediaPipe Tasks requires the following development environment resources:

- OS:
- Python: Supports version 3.9 and later versions
- PIP: version 20.3+

## Developer environment setup

Before running a MediaPipe task on a Python application, install the MediaPipe package.

```
$ python -m pip install mediapipe
```

After installing the package, import it into your development project.

```
import mediapipe as mp
```

## MediaPipe Tasks dependencies

MediaPipe Tasks provides three prebuilt libraries for vision, text, audio. Depending on the MediaPipe Task used by the app, import the vision, text, or audio library into your development project.

### Vision tasks

The MediaPipe Tasks vision module contains tasks that handle image or video inputs. To import the MediaPipe Tasks vision library, import the following dependency to your into your development project.

```
from mediapipe.tasks.python import vision
```

### Text tasks

The MediaPipe Tasks text module contains tasks that handle string inputs.To import the MediaPipe Tasks text library, import the following dependency to your into your development project.

```
from mediapipe.tasks.python import text
```

### Audio tasks

The MediaPipe Tasks audio module contains tasks that handle sound inputs. To import the MediaPipe Tasks audio library, import the following dependency to your into your development project.

```
from mediapipe.tasks.python import audio
```

## BaseOptions configuration

The BaseOptions allow for general configuration of MediaPipe Task APIs.

| Option name | Description | Accepted values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model_asset_buffer` | The model asset file contents. | Model content as a byte string |
| `model_asset_path` | The path of the model asset to open and map into memory. | File path as a string |

## Packaging Python Tasks apps with PyInstaller

When packaging a Python Tasks app with PyInstaller, model files such as `.task` bundles are not included automatically. If your app uses `BaseOptions(model_asset_path=...)`, include the model file in the PyInstaller bundle and resolve its path at runtime.

For example, use a helper that checks for PyInstaller's `sys._MEIPASS` directory:

```
import os
import sys

def resource_path(relative_path: str) -> str:
    base_path = getattr(sys, "_MEIPASS", os.path.abspath("."))
    return os.path.join(base_path, relative_path)
```

Then pass the resolved model path to `BaseOptions`:

```
from mediapipe.tasks import python
from mediapipe.tasks.python import vision

model_path = resource_path("pose_landmarker.task")
base_options = python.BaseOptions(model_asset_path=model_path)
options = vision.PoseLandmarkerOptions(base_options=base_options)
pose_landmarker = vision.PoseLandmarker.create_from_options(options)
```

Bundle the model file and collect MediaPipe package files when building with PyInstaller:

```
pyinstaller app.py \
  --add-data "pose_landmarker.task:." \
  --collect-all mediapipe \
  --hidden-import mediapipe.tasks.c
```

On macOS or Linux, the `--add-data` separator is `:`. On Windows, use `;`. And for macOS desktop apps, add `--windowed` to create an `.app` bundle:
